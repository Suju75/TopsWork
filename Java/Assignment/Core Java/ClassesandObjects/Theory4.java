 * 
  1) Questions:- Defining a Class and Object in Java.
  
  Class:
  A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. 
  It defines the properties (fields) and behaviors (methods) that the objects created from the class will have.
  
  
 Object:
 An object is an instance of a class. It represents a specific entity with the properties and behaviors defined in the class.

2)Questions:- Constructors and Overloading.

Constructors in Java
A constructor is a special method used to initialize objects. It is called automatically when an object is created.

Characteristics of a Constructor:
  
1)The name of the constructor must be the same as the class name.
2)It does not have a return type (not even void).
3)It is automatically invoked when an object is created.
  
Constructor Overloading:
  
Constructor overloading is when a class has multiple constructors with different parameter lists.
The constructor that matches the arguments passed during object creation is called.
 
   
Types of Constructors:

  1)Default Constructor:
  1)A constructor with no parameters.
  2)It initializes the object with default values.
  
  
  2)Parameterized Constructor:
  1)A constructor that takes arguments to initialize the object with specific values.
  
  3)Copy Constructor:
  Copy constructor (object as parameter) clone the object.

3)Questions:-  Object Creation, Accessing Members of the Class.

Object Creation
 In Java, objects are instances of a class. 
 Objects are created using the new keyword, which allocates memory for the object and initializes its fields.
 
 Syntax for Creating an Object:
 
 ClassName objectName = new ClassName();
 
 
 Accessing Members of a Class:

    To access the fields and methods of a class, use the dot operator (.) with the object name.
    
    Syntax
    objectName.fieldName;  // Accessing fields
    objectName.methodName(); // Accessing methods
 
 
*/

//--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


/*
 
3)Questions:- this Keyword. 

The this keyword in Java is a reference variable that refers to the current object of the class.
It has multiple uses, which are explained below:

 key points:
 
 Refers to the Current Object: The this keyword always points to the object that called the method or constructor.
 Resolves Naming Conflicts: Used to differentiate between class fields and local variables or parameters with the same name.
 Supports Constructor Chaining: Allows constructors to call each other within the same class.
 Method Chaining: Enables chaining of methods by returning the current object.
