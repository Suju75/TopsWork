//5. Methods in Java.

/*
1) Questions:- Defining Methods

 Method is a block of code that performs a specific task. Methods allow us to define behaviors for the objects of a class.
 A method typically takes inputs (parameters), processes them, and returns a result (optional).

    The basic syntax for defining a method in Java is:
    returnType methodName(parameter1, parameter2, ...) {
        // method body
        // code that defines the behavior
    }

    four types of methods:
    1. method without parameter and without return type
    2. method with parameter and without return type
    3. method without parameter and with return type
    4. method with parameter and with return type

2) Questions:- Method Parameters and Return Types.

    Methods can have parameters and a return type. Both play an important role in passing data to methods and receiving data back from them.
    
    1. Method Parameters
    Parameters are variables used to pass information into methods. They are declared in the method signature and allow you to send values to 
    the method when it is called. There are two types of parameters in Java:

    Formal Parameters: These are defined in the method signature (the method declaration).
    Actual Parameters (Arguments): These are the values passed to the method when it is called.
    
    
    2.Return Types
    The return type of a method specifies the type of value the method will return. If a method does not return any value, the return type
     is specified as void.

    Primitive Data Types: Methods can return primitive data types such as int, float, char, etc.
    Reference Types: Methods can also return objects, arrays, or other reference types like String or user-defined types.

3) Questions:- Method Overloading in Java.
Method Overloading is a feature in Java that allows a class to have multiple methods with the same name but different parameter lists. 
The compiler differentiates these methods based on the number, type, and sequence of parameters.

/*
4) Questions:- Static Methods and Variables.

1) Static methods in java:

Static Methods:

Definition: A static method is a method that belongs to the class and can be invoked using the class name, without creating an object.
Limitations: Static methods cannot access instance variables or instance methods directly. They can only access other static members.

2) static variable in java:
 
Definition: A static variable is a class-level variable that is shared by all instances (objects) of the class.
Memory Allocation: It is allocated memory once, when the class is loaded, and shared among all instances of the class.
Access: Static variables are accessed using the class name, though they can also be accessed using objects (not recommended).
